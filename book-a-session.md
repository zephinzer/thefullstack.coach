# âœ… Book a Session

The offer for a series of coaching conversations is as follows:

* For first-timers: **6 x 1-hour long sessions at SGD 10/session** \(These fees are needed for credentialing requirements and will help me by enabling me to engage with a mentor coach as well to improve my own coaching. The going-rate for uncertified but professional coaches is upwards of SGD 50/hr so this is quite a steal! :D a small fee also improves the commitment level for both of us\)
* For subsequent sets of sessions after the first, you are free to price these sessions according to the value that you feel it brings to you\(:
* You will receive a recording of our conversation for post-meeting reflections
* You will receive access to my collection of self-development readings/tools
* Mode of coaching is flexible with Zoom as the default mode. I also do Telegram/WhatsApp/in-person as requestable by you. For in-person meetings, I am able to do CBD area as well as the Bishan/Toa Payoh/Serangoon vicinity.
* Payment mode is via PayNow or bank transfer

We will begin with a 30 minute no-obligations introductory call for us to evaluate if we can build a coaching relationship with each other. If all goes well, we will proceed with signing a coaching agreement and then we can start our sessions.
