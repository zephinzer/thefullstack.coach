Engaging me as your coach includes:

1. Access to my curated library of free resources related to self-awareness and personal growth collected from various places
2. A recording of our conversation for you to review during your free time after every session

Regarding payments, I generally follow a pay-what-you-want model depending on the value you perceive coaching brings to you. To improve commitment and accountability, the first set of 6 sessions \(about 2 months duration\) are charged at SGD 10/session \(total of ~SGD 30/month\). Mode of payment can be a resource barter unrelated to my/your performance or via PayNow/bank transfer/cold hard cash. 

For all packages, a minimum of 6 sessions are highly recommended with a minimum of 4 sessions being the hard limit. The following are packages I currently offer:

1. [Blue Skies Conversations](book-a-session.md#blue-skies-conversations)
2. [Conversations for Self-Awareness](book-a-session.md#conversations-for-self-awareness)
3. [Conversations for Communication Patterns](book-a-session.md#conversations-for-communication-patterns)
4. [Conversations for Coordination of Action](book-a-session.md#conversations-for-coordination-of-action)
5. [One-Off Coaching Conversation](book-a-session.md#one-off-coaching-conversation)

## Blue Skies Conversations

**This package is for you if you prefer a series of coaching conversations without being tied to a certain area of development.** This package might be useful if the following sentences are familiar to you:

1. I would like to be coached but I don't really know what to talk about yet
2. I have a problem that I've been stuck with and I want to get unstuck
3. I don't know where to go from where I'm at \(not really sure where I'm at either\)
4. I want to grow but I don't know how else to

## Conversations for Self-Awareness

**This package aims to bring clarity over who you are and how you are in relation to others.** This package might be useful if the following sentences seem familiar to you:

1. I am not sure of who I am
2. I don't know how others perceive me
3. I don't really know where I'm going in life
4. I don't feel like I'm in control of my life
5. I find it difficult to just "_be me_"

Putting these positively, the above would be:

1. I would like to explore more on who I am really
2. I would like to know how others experience me
3. I would like clarity on my direction in life
4. I would like more control over my life
5. I would like to be authentic to myself

## Conversations for Communication Patterns

**This package aims to bring clarity to your interaction patterns with others in your team/life.** This package might be useful if the following sentences seem familiar to you:

1. I find it challenging to build relationships with others
2. I find it difficult to maintain my boundaries with others
3. I find it difficult to ask for things I might need/want
4. I have difficulties with getting people to trust me

Putting these positively, the above would be:

1. I would like to build better relationships with others
2. I would like to better maintain my boundaries when around others
3. I would like to be able to ask for things I want/need effectively
4. I would like people to trust me

## Conversations for Coordination of Action

**This package aims to bring clarity to how you coordinate action and is catered towards team leads/managers of engineering teams.** This package might be useful if the following sentences seem familiar to you:

1. My team never seems to get things '_done_'
2. I can't seem to communicate my vision to my team
3. I can't seem to say no to upper management

Putting these positively, the above would be:

1. I would like to communicate in a way that helps my team to get things '_done_'
2. I would like to effectively communicate my vision to my team
3. I would like to hold my ground when it comes to things I disagree with

## One-Off Coaching Conversation

**This package is a one-off coaching conversation that's available if you already know me personally/have booked sessions with me before**. I charge a flat rate for such conversations at SGD $50 for each session. Bookings for this package must be done through [this link](https://calendly.com/fullstackcoaching/60min) instead of the main link.
