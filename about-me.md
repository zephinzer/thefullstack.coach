# üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Joseph

Hi there, I'm Joseph and I'm someone who is deeply passionate in technology creation through software as well as in facilitating change through enabling people to see things from different perspectives.

I first crossed paths with coaching as a way to help facilitate growth with people back in 2018 during a certain 4-day workshop by The Thought Collective. I've since reinforced my learnings through more of such workshops/programmes and through growing my then-product team, MyCareersFuture at GovTech, from a seed team to a full-fledged product team and am currently with a fintech startup, StashAway, driving change from a technology platforms perspective.

In my professional journey as an engineer, I've been in teams that deliver software with iterative development methodologies \(Agile and friends\) and which practice a culture of DevOps. My role in companies tend to be related to software infrastructure and architecture, and I write code as both a hobby and for a living.

I've just begun my journey in professional coaching and I'm a graduate of the Newfield Ontological Coaching programme of AY20/21. My offer for these coaching conversations is a way for me to both practice my coaching as well as to get certified with the International Coaching Federation \(ICF\) at the Associate Certified Coach \(ACC\) level.
