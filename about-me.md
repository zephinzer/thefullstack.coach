# üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Joseph

Joseph is deeply passionate in technology creation through software as well as in facilitating change through enabling people to see things from different perspectives.

He first crossed paths with coaching as an umbrella methodology to facilitate growth in people in 2018 during a certain 4-day workshop by The Thought Collective. He has since reinforced his learnings through more of such workshops/programmes and through growing his product team, MyCareersFuture, at GovTech from a seed team to a full-fledged product team and is currently with a fintech startup driving change from a technology platforms team.

He has recently brought this interest to a higher level and completed the Newfield Ontological Coaching programme and is currently going for certification with the International Coaching Federation \(ICF\) and is thus offering near-free coaching to gain the practice needed to be certified competent although he assures you he is more than competent at the ACC level.

You might be able to get a better sensing of who he is through [his Medium posts](https://joeir.medium.com/) and [his LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeir).
