# 👆🏻 Going Beyond Full-Stack

Hi there! I'm Joseph and I help technical people like yourself version bump your soft skills so that your technical skills can shine even brighter.

Being an engineer myself, I've seen how improved soft skills can lead to engineering success and I would like to help other engineers like yourself level up through a stack that not many might be familiar with - the human stack!

I do this through a series of coaching conversations that incorporates ontological coaching with my experience working with/in technical people in product teams.
