# üëÜüèª Going Beyond Full-Stack Engineering

![A picture of me incase you were curious &#x270C;&#x1F3FC;](.gitbook/assets/public-001.jpg)

Being an engineer myself, I've seen how improved soft skills can lead to engineering success and I would like to help other technical people like yourself level up in a stack that you might not be too familiar with - the human stack!

I do this through a series of coaching conversations that incorporates ontological coaching with my experience working in product teams.
