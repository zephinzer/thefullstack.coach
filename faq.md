# ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è FAQ

Sometimes in life, we get stuck. When we get stuck, it can be useful to have a conversation partner to look at our issues with a fresh pair of eyes. A different way of seeing things may reveal new things to us, enabling us to take a different set of actions, leading to results we were aiming for but were not previously achieving.

This page is an invitation for a series of coaching conversations with Joseph and here is a list of FAQs that hopefully clears some of your doubts regarding entering a coaching relationship with me

## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **So... What's a coaching conversation?**

A coaching conversation is a type of conversation we enter into with the objective of bringing clarity to issues you may currently be facing, unexplained dissatisfaction with how things are, or exploring potential areas of growth.

This is done through a combination of evoking awareness, insightful questioning, and designing of practices. In the role of a coach, I will facilitate this process which can bring you closer to objectives you've stated or at the very least enable clarity for you on how you'd like to move forward with things.

This clarity typically results in improved well-being and personal satisfaction.

## ü§î **How can coaching help me?**

The objective of a coaching conversation is to explore and bring clarity to aspects of your life where you are seeking improvement/insights into.

This improved clarity can enable improved:

1. Understanding about yourself
2. Understanding over your desired outcomes
3. Understanding of your impact on others
4. Awareness about your physical/social/familial/work environment
5. Interactions with people in your life relative to your goals
6. Sense of direction in life
7. Sense of personal satisfaction

## üë∏üèª **But isn‚Äôt coaching usually for leaders?**

Nope. Anyone can find growth through coaching conversations if growth is what you seek.

While there are coaches and coaching methods which cater exclusively to executives/leaders, coaching conversations can also be done in a way that enables growth in everyday life. This is done typically through:

1. Improvements in how you communicate with family, co-workers, superiors, and friends
2. Improving clarity over your objectives and consequently your resolution to achieve them
3. Exploring areas of dissatisfaction in your life and learn new perspectives that may result in breakthroughs

## üôèüèº **Is coaching the same as mentoring/counselling/etc?**

Yes in some ways but no for the most part. Coaching is one form of conversations that facilitates improvement \(whatever improvement means\) in others. Other similar forms which are NOT coaching include:

1. **Teaching**. Unlike teaching, a coaching relationship does not place the coach in a position of expertise and neither defines what growth/improvement is nor pushes for it. In a coaching relationship, you define what growth means to you and the coach seeks to clarify and facilitate insights into that growth for you.
2. **Training**. Unlike training, coaching does not provide recommendations/best-practices within a well-defined problem domain. Unlike the outcomes of training which is to be able to achieve a pre-determined objective given a skillset, there is no pre-determined objective in coaching. The objectives are set by you at every session and can change as life moves along.
3. **Consulting**. Unlike counsulting, a coaching relationship positions you as the subject matter expert instead of the consultant/coach. The outcomes of consulting are arguably recommendations for the client that will bring the client closer to their stated objectives. A coach does not provide recommendations and also does not provide opinions unless it's for the sake of reflecting back to you their perspective.
4. **Mentoring**. Unlike mentoring, coaching does not assume that you are coming from a place of lesser experience as compared to the mentor/coach. While both mentors and coaches serve you primarily through guidance instead of instruction, mentors do so in the capacity of someone who has more experience/expertise while coaches do so in the capacity of someone partnering you to explore and clarify on your goals
5. **Counselling**. Unlike counselling, coaching assumes that you are "whole" and can be held responsible and accountable for your own learning and action. While explorations in counselling tend to focus on a presented issue and making sense of it through past experiences, coaching focuses on a present objective and making sense of it through alternative ways of observing the environment. In most places, counselling is considered therapy, coaching is not.

**An important re-iteration: COACHING IS NOT THERAPY and does not seek to offer the same kind of processing/healing or address the same issues as therapy does.**

## üìä **What frameworks/methodologies will be used?**

The type of coaching I do is termed ontological coaching and it seeks to coach via both the 'who' and the 'what' depending on needs, making it effective for all kinds of issues faced in life.

In ontological coaching, the first model to consider is known as Observer-Action-Results. The Observer refers to how you see the world around you, which opens up possibilities for Action to happen that generates some kind of Results. When these Results are not what is desired, we can either change the Action so we achieve a different Result, or we can change the Observer which opens up different Actions to us. When we say we get 'stuck' in something, we've usually exhausted all known Actions, which means taking a look at the Observer is usually something that's more effective than analysing our Actions - which is ontological coaching in a nutshell: coaching that shifts the Observer.

This shifting in perspectives is achieved via an exploration of the ontological model known as Body-Emotions-Language. Body refers to physical sensations and represents our instincts as humans. Emotions refer to feelings we get that drives us to perform certain actions. Language refers to how we interact with the world around us. These three domains arguably comprise _being_ - hence ontological.

**In short, ontological coaching seeks to provide the coachee with a different perspective about themselves and how they relate with the world through their** _**being**_**.**

This paradigm of coaching is commonly referred to as "coaching the who not the what" and is employed primarily by an international organisation and one of the top coaching schools known as Newfield.

To find out more about this type of coaching, you can also google for "ontological coaching".

## üí° **What topics can/should I talk about?**

Nothing is off-limits. Like any relationship however, trust enables deeper issues to be brought to the conversation and this will be built up over the course of our sessions.

If you're facing an unexplained dissastisfaction with how things are and are wondering what you could bring into a coaching conversation, I typically use a concept called The Wheel of Life comprising of the following umbrella areas of life which also represent areas that we can talk about to explore dissastisfaction:

1. Physical environment and safety
2. Personal finance
3. Health
4. Social relationships
5. Romantic relationships
6. Career/working relationships
7. Personal growth
8. Fun and recreation

## ü§ê **Will things we talk about be kept secret?**

Our conversations will be 100% confidential unless it involves **self-harm** \(to which I might attempt to notify mental health support services/your close contacts\) or it **breaks the law** \(to which I am obligated under the law to inform the relevant authority\). This will be done in your interest to prevent you from getting into situations that do not benefit your well-being/personal satisfaction in life in the long term.

Another condition where what we talk about may be released to someone else is when I ask for explicit written permission to share our recordings/conversation topics with someone/some group for purposes of getting mentorship/guidance on my own coaching practice, for certification purposes, or as an example in an article I'm writing/class I'm teaching. In such situations, only your voice/what you said will be used with an alias used in place of your name. For certification requirements, your contact details might be needed, but I will inform you of what I'm releasing to them beforehand and you are free to reject it if you don't feel good about it for any reason.

## üì¶ **What's the structure of a coaching conversation like?**

A series of coaching conversations comprises a number of sessions that we agree on prior to beginning the coaching. This is typically a span of 6 sessions that can be extended or cut short.

There will be two agreements governing our sessions at any point in time. The first agreement covers the course of sessions we have agreed to. Think of it like setting boundaries within which you'd like to explore. The second agreement will happen during every session where we will verbally confirm what is most useful for us to discuss for you at that point in time.

Each session is 45-60 minutes in duration and will be spaced out 2-3 weeks in between to provide space for thoughts to be generated and actions to be taken should there be. Both you and I reserve the right to terminate the relationship out of ethical or personal concerns.

The first session will be a deep-dive into your objectives and subsequent sessions loosely follow the structure of:

1. **Session agreement** - this is where we agree on and explore what would be useful for you to talk about
2. **Contextual exploration** - a logical exploration of the issue at hand, what happened, who's involved, what's at stake for you
3. **Coaching exploration** - an experiential exploration of the issue at hand, how you feel about it, what your desires are/are not
4. **Designing action** - building on what has been brought up, we will partner to create practices that you can do to bring you closer to an objective
5. **Feedback** - this section enables us to be flexible with our structure and adjust our interactions/objectives as the relationship is built

## üí∞ **What is the coaching package/pricing like?**

To be clear, I'm not a certified coach, but I have completed the Newfield Ontological Coaching programme and I'm working towards an Associate Certified Coach \(ACC\) certification by the International Coaching Federation \(ICF\).
